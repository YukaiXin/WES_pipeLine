# WES_pipeLine

This pipeline is for me to learn WES.

#Background
    WES stands for whole-exome sequencing which is gaining popularity in the human genetics community due to the moderato costs,manageable data amounts and straightforward interpretation of analysis results.
    So far, there are more than 300 open source softwares for WES data analysis supporting five distinct analytic steps:
* quality control
* alignment
* variant identification
* variant annotation
* visualization


##for relevant software,you can download from biaconda  (www.bioconda.github.io)

you need to create a config files£¬just like below:
